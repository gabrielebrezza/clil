            <h2>Hydrogen Fuel Cells</h2>
            <p>Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, emitting only water vapor as a byproduct. This technology is used in various transportation modes, including buses, trucks, and trains.</p>
            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quick refueling times:</strong> Hydrogen vehicles can be refueled in minutes, unlike battery electric vehicles that may take longer to charge.</li>
                <li><strong>Longer range:</strong> Hydrogen vehicles typically offer a greater driving range compared to their battery counterparts.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower weight:</strong> Hydrogen fuel cells are lighter than traditional batteries, making vehicles more efficient.</li>
